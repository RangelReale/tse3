    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

    <p>
    Below are listed some commonly found problems. If you can't get TSE3
    working then look here. If you don't find the answer, then just ask!

    <hr>

    <dl>

      <dt><b>I can't get any output</b></dt>
      <dd>When you run <code>tse3play</code> do you get any errors? If so then
          look for a description below.
          <p>
          If not, do you have your soundcard installed correctly? You can
          run <code>tse3play</code> with the <code>--verbose</code> parameter
          to get some diagnostics about the setup of your soundcard. If no
          soundcard is listed then try reinstalling it.<br>
          If you do have a soundcard installed and setup properly, is it's
          volume raised, and have you got your speaker cable in the correct
          socket?
          <p>
          Does the soundcard support both MIDI and audio output - the
          <code>--verbose</code> output will tell you which output TSE3
          uses by default; trying forcing it to another port with
          <code>--force-port</code>.</dd>

      <dt><b>I get the message "Opening FM patch file failed"</b></dt>
      <dd>You have an FM soundcard and so TSE3 tries to load the FM patches
          file on your computer to put sounds into your soundcard. The
          files are commonly found in <code>/etc/midi</code>, however on
          your system the files are not here.<br>
          The files TSE3 is looking for are: <code>std.o3</code>,
          <code>std.sb</code>, <code>drums.o3</code> and <code>drums.sb</code>.
          If you locate this file, try running <code>tse3play</code> with
          the <code>--patches-dir</code> parameter.</dd>

      <dt><b>I get the message "Opening GUS patch file failed"</b></dt>
      <dd>You have a GUS soundcard and so TSE3 tries to load the GUS patches
          files on your compueter to put sounds into your soundcard. The
          files are commonly found in <code>/etc/midi</code>, however on your
          system the files are not here.<br>
          The files TSE3 is looking for are <code>*.pat</code>, which
          includes, for example, <code>acpiano.pat</code> and
          <code>epiano1.pat</code>.
          If you locate this file, try running <code>tse3play</code> with
          the <code>--patches-dir</code> parameter.</dd>
