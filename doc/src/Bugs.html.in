    <h1>Known bugs and issues</h1>

    <p>
    The TSE3 library is constantly under development. All
    <a href="Feedback.html">feedback</a> is welcomed to help improve the
    library.

    <p>
    There follows a list of the <i>known</i> bug and issues. If you can inform
    me of any other problems then I will be grateful.

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>A number of integer size checks need to be added to the build
          process. If your machine has int &lt; 32 bits then the library will
          not work.
      <li>The <code>DeMIDIfy</code> utility class is not proven to work
          properly (this will wait until the graphical visualisation).
      <li>The application and commands classes are not very complete yet.
          These will be added as and when I need them whilst writing the
          Anthem sequencer, which uses this library.
    </ul>
