    <h1>TSE3 library history</h1>

    <p>
    TSE is an acronym for the <b>Trax Sequencer Engine</b>. The developer, Pete
    Goodliffe releases software under the moniker 'Trax Software'. TSE was
    originally developed for a sequencing project provisionally titled
    TraxSequencer.
    <p>
    TSE technology dates from 1996. The first version took a pattern based approach
    to the song structure which limited it's flexibility.
    <P>
    TSE1 lead rapidly to TSE2 which was developed and improved between 1997-1999.
    This was targetted at the Acorn RISC OS architecture only, although in theory
    should have been fairly portable. TSE2 is a linear sequencer engine. You
    record snatches of music called Phrases, and then place them inside Parts
    which are further put into the Tracks of a Song. This approach was
    considerably more flexible and powerful that the TSE1 approach.
    <P>
    TSE2 found its way into several RISC OS products. The first generation of
    TSE2 powered the TraxSequencer product. Later revisions to TSE2 and the
    user interface lead to the product Anthem. At its release Anthem was
    acclaimed as a new powerful way of sequencing, challenging the accepted norm.
    <P>
    TSE2 based products were only available commercially. See the
    <A href="http://www.rcomp.co.uk/rci/sound/anthem/anthem.htm">R-Comp</a>
    website for more information.
    <P>
    TSE3 is a third generation project based on the experience of TSE2. It
    includes the same revolutionary functionality but takes it into a new
    generation of implementation. Based on experience with TSE2, TSE3 provides
    a robust and powerful engine with greater extensability and portability.
    It draws on experience with TSE2 use in it's partitioning of the sequencer engine logic,
    the application support logic, the platform specific interfaces and the
    application itself in the most appropriate manner.
    <p>
    The C++ code has been brought up to a much more modern standard, leveraging
    the STL and other appropriate language features.
    <p>
    The other major difference between TSE2 and TSE3 is the release conditions. TSE3
    is an open source project, allowing it to be used with few restrictions. It has been
    designed to be used by as large an audience as possible; indeed to be the defacto
    open source sequencer engine.
