    <h1>TSE3 library copyright details</h1>

    <p>
    TSE3 is released under the terms of the <b>GNU General Public
    License</b>. See the COPYING file included in the
    source package, or visit the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU website</a>

    TSE3 is copyright &copy; Pete Goodliffe 2000-2003.
    <p>
    You may freely use TSE3 under the license terms. In addition to this, I request
    that if you use the library you:
    <ol>
      <li>Tell me (so I can keep a track of how much it is being used, and
          learn how I can improve it)
      <li>Display a notice in the program (perhaps the <b>Help->About</b>
          dialogue) and also in the documentation crediting use of the library.
          Something like <i>'Uses TSE3 technology'</i> is sufficient. You should
          provide access to the version strings in the <code>TSE3.h</code> file in the
          program. I also have a small logo which you may wish to use.
    </ol>

    <p>
    If you are interested in licensing TSE3 under a different conditions, then
