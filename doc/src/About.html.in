    <h1>About the TSE3 library</h1>

    <p>
    TSE3 is a portable open source 'sequencer engine' written in C++.
    It provides programmers with rich and powerful sequencing capabilities.
    It is a 'sequencer engine' becuase it provides the actual driving force
    elements of a sequencer but provides no form of user interface.
    <p>
    TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience. Versions of TSE have
    been in use for a number of years. Whilst not providing the user interface, it
    provides a lot of assistance to a UI, attempting to provide as much functionality
    as possible in as generic a manner as possible.

    <p>
    TSE3 is a product of Trax Software, written by Pete Goodliffe.

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <p>
    TSE3 provides a feature packed system, with a simple coherent API for application useage.
    It's advanced sequencer engine features include:
    <ul>
        <li>Powerful linear sequencer
        <li>Flexible object-oriented song structure
        <li>Handles import and export of standard MIDI files (both type 0 and type 1)
        <li>Provides own extensible song format (TSE3MDL)
        <li>Threading support for background playback
        <li>Playback with real time effects (remapping, quantise, velocity window clipping,
            repeat, offset etc)
        <li>GM/GS/XG support
        <li>Synchro start of playback
        <li>Powerful utilities for song manipulation: power quantise, arpeggiator etc.
        <li>Highly configurable metronome
        <li>MIDI echo facility
        <li>MIDI command filters
        <li>Imports Cakewalk instrument definition files
        <li>Flag points in timeline
    </ul>
    <p>
    Addtionally, TSE3 provides a level of application support. Common tasks that a sequencing
    application would implement that can be taken out of the user interface logic and placed at
    a higher level are provided within the TSE3 library. It therefore also offers the following
    facilities:
    <ul>
        <li>Command pattern for operations, providing a flexible undo/redo facility.
        <li>Support for an extensible choices file that can be saved on program start/stop or
            at any other time. Common TSE3 features are saved, and the application can attach
            further blocks of specific choices.
    </ul>

    <h3>tse3play - the multi-format playback utility</h3>

    <p>
    The TSE3 library also comes with a sample application that uses the library,
    <b>tse3play</b>. This program is a command-line TSE3MDL and MIDI file player
    with a host of control features.
