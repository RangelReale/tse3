    <h1>Porting TSE3</h1>

    <p>
    Porting TSE3 to another platform is a relatively simple task. Since it
    is written in modern, standards-compliant C++ the majority of the code
    will compile without problem.

    <p>
    Whilst TSE3 was developed on Linux, it has already been sucessfully
    compiled on BSD, RISC OS, and Windows operating systems.

    <p>
    The main porting concern is to implement the
    <a href="api/TSE3__MidiScheduler.html"><code>MidiScheduler</code></a> class.
    This is the library interface to the underlying MIDI platform. You will
    need to consult the documentation for your platform for information on how
    to do this, you can see the existing implementations for inspiration.

    <p>
    If you are compiling on a unix-based platform then the build structure
    should work for you already - the autotools should cope OK. Other
    build environments may be required for different platforms.
